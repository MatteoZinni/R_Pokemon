# DATA SCIENCE USING POKEMON
# INTRODUCING POKEMON
Pokémon are creatures of all shapes and sizes who live in the wild or alongside humans. The concept of the Pokémon comes from the hobby  - quite common in Japan - to collect insects as stated by their creator Satoshi Tajiri. Pokèmon can be wild or tamed by a person called "Trainer". A Pokèmon trainer goals are tipically to complete the Pokédex by collecting all of the available Pokémon species found in the fictional region and to train a team of powerful Pokémon from those he has caught. Just like other lifeforms, Pokémon grow, level up and become more experienced and even, on occasion, evolve into stronger Pokémon.
