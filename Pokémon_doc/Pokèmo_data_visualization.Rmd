## introducing the dataset

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r reading dataset, include=FALSE}
pokemon = read.csv(file.choose(), dec = ".", quote = "\"")
pokemon = pokemon[,-1]
```

```{r edit df, include=FALSE}
#remove japanese name column
pokemon = pokemon[,-29]

# make the the first letter capital
headers = gsub("(?<=^|_)([a-z])", "\\U\\1", colnames(pokemon), perl=TRUE)

# replace headers
colnames(pokemon) = headers

# edit some variables names to look smarter
colnames(pokemon)[27] <- "Height_m"
colnames(pokemon)[35] <- "Type_1"
colnames(pokemon)[36] <- "Type_2"

# edit generation name to display roman numeral
Generation = factor(pokemon$Generation, levels=c(1:7), labels = as.roman(c(1:7)))

# replace column
pokemon$Generation <- Generation
```


```{r check head df, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(pokemon)
```
